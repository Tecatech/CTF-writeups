#PoWdle

First, we create a PoW brute-force solver, which will generate a PoW string with the desired guess prefix given challenge prefix. Now, we can play the game, but notice it is impossibly difficult to pass the highscore of 9000. However, there is an command injection if we pass a score of 3000. To trigger the command injection, we need the high score path to throw an error. We can do this with ReDOS. The following regex causes a DOS: `'@'*(1651) + '.'*1651 + '\t'`, which will trigger the timeout decorator and throw an exception. The injection payload we use as email is: `";base64<flag;@."` plus the DOS payload. Then, we just play the game manually and get a score > 3000 to trigger the bug.
