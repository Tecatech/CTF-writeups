The bug is in the store to memory VM instruction when we enter mem size of (1 << 64) / 8 due to integer overflow. We can store OOB of mem indirectly from heap. To obtain heap and libc leak, use timing attack on uninitialized mem chunk unsorted and tcache FD ptrs. Use arb write to overwrite fs:0x30 exit\_handler xor key, and overwrite dl\_fini exit\_handler function to trigger system("/bin/sh")
